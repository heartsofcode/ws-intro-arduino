# Electricity


There is a lot to say about electricity, but we'll keep it short and try to focus on what we need for our workshop.

This is mostly about defining terms and explaining what they mean and giving them some context. While it's not crucial at all to understand everything written here, it's still handy knowledge to have.

## What is electricity really?

*(This section is maybe a little over the top in terms of detail. Feel free to skip to [the next section]() if you're fine with not having to know every single last bit of how stuff works).*

Electricity is the flow of electric charge. Electric charge is a physical property of all matter, like mass or density, and can be measured.

On an atomic level, it is (negatively charged) electrons (hence the name) flowing from atom to atom. Some electrons are loosely attached to their atomic cores, we call them conductive. Some electrons are very strongly attached to their atomic cores, we call them insulated.

Electrons in conductive materials don't just start flowing on their own though, we need to give them a little push. If this push is constant and electrons are flowing constantly, we call it (electric) current.

The path that the electrons flow by is determined by the way of conductive material. The path we build for electrons is called a circuit. It is kind of circular must be free of any gaps.

Last piece we're missing is the constant push that makes the electrons flow. We need to store some electric potential energy in an electric field that we can use to do work (that's a fancy way of saying battery, huh?). This work consists of electric potential pushing electrons in one direction.

Electric potential is the term used to describe the amount of electric potential energy stored in electric fields (the electric potential energy divided by the amount of charge at one point). We usually refer to it as voltage, the difference between low and high points of electric potential in the electric field. It tells us about the pushing force of the field. It's unit is volt.

Now we have electricity!

We've left out some things and glossed over some others. If you want to dig deeper into the physics, Sparkfun has an extensive and really good post on [how electricity works](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/what-is-electricity/all).
