# Electricity


There is a lot to say about electricity, but we'll keep it short and try to focus on what we need for our workshop.

## What is electricity really?

Electricity is the flow of electric charge. Electric charge is a physical property of all matter, like mass or density, and can be measured.

On an atomic level, it is (negatively charged) electrons (hence the name) flowing from atom to atom. Some electrons are loosely attached to their atomic cores, we call them conductive. Some electrons are very strongly attached to their atomic cores, we call them insulated.

Electrons in conductive materials don't just start flowing on their own, we need to give them a little push. If this push is constant and electrons are flowing constantly, we call it a current.

The path that the electrons flow by is determined by the way of conductive material. The path we build for electrons, from a power source to ground, is called a circuit. It is kind of circular.



If you want to dig even deeper into the physics, Sparkfun has an extensive post on [how electricity works](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/what-is-electricity/all).
