# Workshop preface

This is an online documentation and material for an introductory workshop on Arduino (-like) micro-controllers.

The workshop itself assumes a hands-on setting and in the nature of micro-controllers this includes certain hardware to be present. Please refer to the [hardware section](#hardware) of this preface to see what you need in order to follow the workshop on your own.

The time frame for the base workshop is about 2 hours but depending on your previous knowledge and support this can be longer or shorter. It aims to go from "What is a circuit?" to program a blinking LED.

## Workshop audience

This workshop assumes no prior experience in working with hardware, electronics, embedded programming, micro-controllers or similar. It aims to be short and simple introduction to the field that participants can try out in one evening.

However, we will assume some basic programming knowledge. If you know what if-else are and have called a function before, you'll be fine.

## Hardware

Ideally each participant (or a group of two) has an Arduino uno or similar controller, a USB cable to connect it to a computer,  at least one LED and a resistor, some jumper cables and a sensor of choice.

A lot of stores offer beginner kits or sets that should include all of the above.
