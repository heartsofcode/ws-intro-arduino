# Basics

We'll start with physics! This will give us an understanding of [how electricity works](/basics/electricity.html) and will be useful when we need to build our own circuits.

After that, we'll take a look at some common [electronics parts](/basics/electronics.html) we'll be using in our first circuit and later on.

Then, we'll get to know [the board](/basics/micro-controllers.html) we'll be working with, the Arduino uno (or a similarly laid-out board).

To finish with the basics, we'll set up and get to know the [Arduino IDE](/basics/development-setup.html).
